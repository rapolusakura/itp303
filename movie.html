			<h3> Summary </h3>
			<img src="https://d31029zd06w0t6.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2019/04/web1_the_shawshank_redemption_-_h_-_1994.jpg" /> 
			<p> The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont, based on the 1982 Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. It tells the story of banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murders of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. Over the following two decades, he befriends a fellow prisoner, contraband smuggler Ellis "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman), and becomes instrumental in a money-laundering operation led by the prison warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton). William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows, and James Whitmore appear in supporting roles. 

Darabont purchased the film rights to King's story in 1987, but development did not begin until five years later, when he wrote the script over an eight-week period. Two weeks after submitting his script to Castle Rock Entertainment, Darabont secured a $25 million budget to produce The Shawshank Redemption, which started pre-production in January 1993. While the film is set in Maine, principal photography took place from June to August 1993 almost entirely in Mansfield, Ohio, with the Ohio State Reformatory serving as the eponymous penitentiary. The project attracted many stars of the time for the role of Andy, including Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise, and Kevin Costner. Thomas Newman provided the film's score.

			<h3> 5 Things I Learned from Shawshank Redemption </h3>

				<li>Rock hammers are really powerful. During the movie, Red underestimated the power of it but Andy was able to use it to carve out a tunnel for himself over the course of a few years. </li>
				<li>You can survive and make the best of any situation by having hope. Red acknowledges that he became 'institutionalized' meaning that he thought of the walls of the prison as his home, and he was accustomed to his life there so he didn't try to actively change his situation like Andy. </li>
				<li>The incarceration system is corrupt. The warden took bribes and was doing illegal activity, the officers had favorite inmates and gave them special treatment, etc. </li>
				<li>The strength of your relationships can help you get through anything.</li>
				<li>Small habits every day can make a big difference over time.</li>
